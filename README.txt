You may use any Meemoo project under the terms of either the MIT License or the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) Version 3.

The MIT License is recommended for most projects using Meemoo. It is simple and easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with Meemoo. http://meemoo.org/iframework/LICENSE-MIT.txt

If the AGPL suits your project better you are also free to use Meemoo under that license. http://meemoo.org/iframework/LICENSE-AGPL.txt

You don’t have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and you don’t have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to use Meemoo in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.
